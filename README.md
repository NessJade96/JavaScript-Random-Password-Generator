# JavaScript-Random-Password-Generator

A simple random password generator made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

# Planning Notes:

Create a prompt to display when the button "generate password' is clicked.

This prompt will display password critetia, password length\*, for eg. the first will display Numbers, second, uppercase, third, Special characters, and finally, lower case. So create 4 promt windows (4 functions?)

\*password length <=8 charaters and =<128 characters

At least one of the character type prompts has to be selected, as well as the password length chosen.

The password is then created and displayed in an alert or written to the page.
